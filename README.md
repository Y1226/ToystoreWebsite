## Toy Store Website

This website serves as a user-friendly interface for a toy store. It was created during the early stages of my programming studies to demonstrate proficiency in HTML.

### Project Overview:

The project requirements were to create a website primarily using HTML, showcasing fundamental knowledge of HTML concepts. The website's primary aim was to provide a user-friendly experience for visitors, with features tailored for both customers and managers.

### Features:

#### For Customers:
- View information about the store.
- Contact the store.
- Add items to the shopping cart.
- View their profile, shopping cart, and previous orders.

#### For Managers:
- Add or edit any information on the website.
- Respond to customer queries.
- View customer details, including their orders.

### Project Limitations:

This project is built using HTML only and does not incorporate any backend or database functionality. Therefore, it does not persist changes or fully simulate the behavior of a real e-commerce site.

### Purpose:

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in HTML and fulfill the requirements of the assignment. Despite its limitations, the project successfully meets the specified requirements, and I received a high grade for its completion.
